        <h1>Procedure:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a paring knife, remove the part of the pomegranate that looks like a crown. I like angling my paring knife downward and making a circle around the crown.</li>
            <li>Score the pomegranate into sections. I find scoring the fruit 4 times is enough for me, but feel free to score it a few more times.</li>
            <li>Break open the pomegranate into sections.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with cool water. Break apart the pomegranate arils underneath the water. It helps prevent pomegranate juice from squirting everywhere. (By the way, don’t wear light colored clothes while you’re doing this.) Drain the water from the pomegranate arils when you’re done separating them from the rind.</li>
            <li>Pour the arils into a blender. Blend until all the arils have been crushed but most of the seeds are still in tact. This usually takes no more than 15 to 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour the juice through a strainer. You’ll notice that the juice passes through the strainer pretty slowly because the pulp is pretty thick. To speed up the process, use a rubber spatula to press the pulp agains the strainer. The juice should drip through faster.</li>
            <li>Pour juice into a glass to serve. 5 to 6 large pomegranates should yield about 4 cups of juice. Leftover juice can be refrigerated in a jar for 5 to 6 days.</li>
