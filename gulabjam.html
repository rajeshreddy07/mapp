         <h1>Procedure:</h1>
         <ol>
         <li> In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of milk powder, 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, and a pinch of baking soda.
      </li>
         <li>Gradually add 2 tablespoons of ghee (clarified butter) and mix until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
      </li>
         <li>Slowly pour in 2-3 tablespoons of milk and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Let it rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
  
      <li>Meanwhile, in a deep saucepan, heat oil or ghee for frying on medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth balls without any cracks.
      </li>
      <li>Carefully drop the balls into the hot oil and fry them until they turn golden brown. Make sure to fry them in batches for even cooking.
      </li>
      <li>Once fried, remove the Gulab Jamuns from the oil and let them cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>In a separate saucepan, combine 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water, and a few strands of saffron. Bring it to a boil and let the sugar dissolve completely.
      </li>
      <li>Add a few drops of rose water or cardamom powder to the sugar syrup for flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Gently place the fried Gulab Jamuns into the warm sugar syrup and let them soak for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve the Gulab Jamuns warm or at room temperature. They taste delicious on their own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!
